So, to guide **Eniac** with these 2 aspects, we have gathered some data from Magist & showcased the insights which will be helpful for Eniac to decide.

## Tools Used:

3. Google Slides to present & summarize the data with conclusion.
   
## Datasource:
We have used Magist's database to extract the exact data & visualize it to summarize.

## Project Contributors:
Group of 4 peoples contributed in this project work.

## Key Learnings:
1. Understand the Magist's database in MySQL by reverse engineering & EER diagram.
2. Using sql queries extract the information from tables & use it solve business questions.
3. Visualize the key findings using Tableau.
4. Research the Brazilian market and put the data into context.
5. Analyzed the data & discussed within group members to reach a conclusion.

## Approach
The assessment of Magist involves a comprehensive evaluation based on the following criteria:

1) Partnership Suitability: Assessing Magistâ€™s revenue and suitability as a partner for the sale of high-quality technology products.
2) Delivery Times: Analyzing the efficiency of Magist's delivery processes and distribution of costs. Brazil average delivery times.
3) Customer Satisfaction: Evaluating customer satisfaction levels associated with Magist's services.


## Conclusion:
We have concluded our presentation as:

1.Magist is not a seller specialized in technology, only 15% of the total products are tech products, and most are considered cheap.
2.Magist is great at delivering their products on time and has fantastic customer happiness. Deliveries faster than the national average.
Based on the dimensions and shipping costs of the products in the database, it was concluded that the shipping cost was well below the normal demands. Since Magist delivers mostly heavy produts such as furniture, The freight cost is quite affordable.
3.Customer satisfaction is high. 


**We recommend Magisti as our partner when entering the Brazilian market.**
